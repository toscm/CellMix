abstract = {Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a complex spectrum of cellular and molecular characteristics including several dramatic changes in the populations of peripheral leukocytes. These changes include general leukopenia, activation of B and T cells, and maturation of granulocytes. The manifestation of SLE in peripheral blood is central to the disease but is incompletely understood. A technique for rigorously characterizing changes in mixed populations of cells, microarray expression deconvolution, has been applied to several areas of biology but not to SLE or to blood. Here we demonstrate that microarray expression deconvolution accurately quantifies the constituents of real blood samples and mixtures of immune-derived cell lines. We characterize a broad spectrum of peripheral leukocyte cell types and states in SLE to uncover novel patterns including: specific activation of NK and T helper lymphocytes, relationships of these patterns to each other, and correlations to clinical variables and measures. The expansion and activation of monocytes, NK cells, and T helper cells in SLE at least partly underlie this disease's prominent interferon signature. These and other patterns of leukocyte dynamics uncovered here correlate with disease severity and treatment, suggest potential new treatments, and extend our understanding of lupus pathology as a complex autoimmune disease involving many arms of the immune system.},

abstract = {Large-scale molecular profiling technologies have assisted the identification of disease biomarkers and facilitated the basic understanding of cellular processes. However, samples collected from human subjects in clinical trials possess a level of complexity, arising from multiple cell types, that can obfuscate the analysis of data derived from them. Failure to identify, quantify, and incorporate sources of heterogeneity into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on subsequent statistical studies.We describe an approach that builds upon a linear latent variable model, in which expression levels from mixed cell populations are modeled as the weighted average of expression from different cell types. We solve these equations using quadratic programming, which efficiently identifies the globally optimal solution while preserving non-negativity of the fraction of the cells. We applied our method to various existing platforms to estimate proportions of different pure cell or tissue types and gene expression profilings of distinct phenotypes, with a focus on complex samples collected in clinical trials.We tested our methods on several well controlled benchmark data sets with known mixing fractions of pure cell or tissue types and mRNA expression profiling data from samples collected in a clinical trial. Accurate agreement between predicted and actual mixing fractions was observed. In addition, our method was able to predict mixing fractions for more than ten species of circulating cells and to provide accurate estimates for relatively rare cell types (<10\% total population). Furthermore, accurate changes in leukocyte trafficking associated with Fingolomid (FTY720) treatment were identified that were consistent with previous results generated by both cell counts and flow cytometry. These data suggest that our method can solve one of the open questions regarding the analysis of complex transcriptional data: namely, how to identify the optimal mixing fractions in a given experiment.},

We have compiled a compendium of microarray expression data for virtually all human genes from six key immune cell types and their activated and differentiated states. Immune Response In Silico (IRIS) is a collection of genes that have been selected for specific expression in immune cells. The expression pattern of IRIS genes recapitulates the phylogeny of immune cells in terms of the lineages of their differentiation. Gene Ontology assignments for IRIS genes reveal significant involvement in inflammation and immunity. Genes encoding CD antigens, cytokines, integrins and many other gene families playing key roles in the immune response are highly represented. IRIS also includes proteins of unknown function and expressed sequence tags that may not represent genes. The predicted cellular localization of IRIS proteins is evenly distributed between cell surface and intracellular compartments, indicating that immune specificity is important at many points in the signaling pathways of the immune response. IRIS provides a resource for further investigation into the function of the immune system and immune diseases.},

  abstract = {A major challenge for the field of transplantation is the lack of understanding of genomic and molecular drivers of early post-transplant immunity. The early immune response creates a complex milieu that determines the course of ensuing immune events and the ultimate outcome of the transplant. The objective of the current study was to mechanistically deconvolute the early immune response by purifying and profiling the constituent cell subsets of the peripheral blood. We employed genome-wide profiling of whole blood and purified CD4, CD8, B cells and monocytes in tandem with high-throughput laser-scanning cytometry in 10 kidney transplants sampled serially pre-transplant, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Cytometry confirmed early cell subset depletion by antibody induction and immunosuppression. Multiple markers revealed the activation and proliferative expansion of CD45RO(+)CD62L(-) effector memory CD4/CD8 T cells as well as progressive activation of monocytes and B cells. Next, we mechanistically deconvoluted early post-transplant immunity by serial monitoring of whole blood using DNA microarrays. Parallel analysis of cell subset-specific gene expression revealed a unique spectrum of time-dependent changes and functional pathways. Gene expression profiling results were validated with 157 different probesets matching all 65 antigens detected by cytometry. Thus, serial blood cell monitoring reflects the profound changes in blood cell composition and immune activation early post-transplant. Each cell subset reveals distinct pathways and functional programs. These changes illuminate a complex, early phase of immunity and inflammation that includes activation and proliferative expansion of the memory effector and regulatory cells that may determine the phenotype and outcome of the kidney transplant.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Blood is a complex tissue comprising numerous cell types with distinct functions and corresponding gene expression profiles. We attempted to define the cell type specific gene expression patterns for the major constituent cells of blood, including B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, lymphocytes and granulocytes. We did this by comparing the global gene expression profiles of purified B-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, granulocytes, and lymphocytes using cDNA microarrays. RESULTS: Unsupervised clustering analysis showed that similar cell populations from different donors share common gene expression profiles. Supervised analyses identified gene expression signatures for B-cells (427 genes), T-cells (222 genes), CD8+ T-cells (23 genes), granulocytes (411 genes), and lymphocytes (67 genes). No statistically significant gene expression signature was identified for CD4+ cells. Genes encoding cell surface proteins were disproportionately represented among the genes that distinguished among the lymphocyte subpopulations. Lymphocytes were distinguishable from granulocytes based on their higher levels of expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, while granulocytes exhibited characteristic expression of various cell surface and inflammatory proteins. CONCLUSION: The genes comprising the cell-type specific signatures encompassed many of the genes already known to be involved in cell-type specific processes, and provided clues that may prove useful in discovering the functions of many still unannotated genes. The most prominent feature of the cell type signature genes was the enrichment of genes encoding cell surface proteins, perhaps reflecting the importance of specialized systems for sensing the environment to the physiology of resting leukocytes.},

To further understand hematopoiesis, we have compared gene expression profiles of human erythroblasts, megakaryocytes, B cells, cytotoxic and helper T cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes, and monocytes using whole genome microarrays. A bioinformatics analysis of these data was performed focusing on transcription factors, immunoglobulin superfamily members, and lineage-specific transcripts. We observed that the numbers of lineage-specific genes varies by 2 orders of magnitude, ranging from 5 for cytotoxic T cells to 878 for granulocytes. In addition, we have identified novel coexpression patterns for key transcription factors involved in hematopoiesis (eg, GATA3-GFI1 and GATA2-KLF1). This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of gene expression in hematopoietic cells to date and has identified genes that play key roles in lineage commitment and cell function. The data, which are freely accessible, will be invaluable for future studies on hematopoiesis and the role of specific genes and will also aid the understanding of the recent genome-wide association studies.},

However, the links among TSGs, diseases, and potential therapeutic agents are often missing, hidden, or too scattered to find. There is a need to establish a knowledgebase for researchers to share this and additional information in order to speed up discovery and clinical practice. As an initiative toward systems biology, the VeryGene web server was developed to fill this gap. A significant effort has been made to integrate TSGs from two large-scale data analyses with respective information on subcellular localization, Gene Ontology, Reactome, KEGG pathway, Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) Mammalian Phenotype, disease association, and targeting drugs. The current release carefully selected 3,960 annotated TSGs derived from 127 normal human tissues and cell types, including 5,672 gene-disease and 2,171 drug-target relationships. In addition to being a specialized source for TSGs, VeryGene can be used as a discovery tool by generating novel inferences. Some inherently useful but hidden relations among genes, diseases, drugs, and other important aspects can be inferred to form testable hypotheses.

  abstract = {Heterogeneity in sample composition is an inherent issue in many gene expression studies and, in many cases, should be taken into account in the downstream analysis to enable correct interpretation of the underlying biological processes. Typical examples are infectious diseases or immunology-related studies using blood samples, where, for example, the proportions of lymphocyte sub-populations are expected to vary between cases and controls. Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is an unsupervised learning technique that has been applied successfully in several fields, notably in bioinformatics where its ability to extract meaningful information from high-dimensional data such as gene expression microarrays has been demonstrated. Very recently, it has been applied to biomarker discovery and gene expression deconvolution in heterogeneous tissue samples. Being essentially unsupervised, standard NMF methods are not guaranteed to find components corresponding to the cell types of interest in the sample, which may jeopardize the correct estimation of cell proportions. We have investigated the use of prior knowledge, in the form of a set of marker genes, to improve gene expression deconvolution with NMF algorithms. We found that this improves the consistency with which both cell type proportions and cell type gene expression signatures are estimated. The proposed method was tested on a microarray dataset consisting of pure cell types mixed in known proportions. Pearson correlation coefficients between true and estimated cell type proportions improved substantially (typically from about 0.5 to approximately 0.8) with the semi-supervised (marker-guided) versions of commonly used NMF algorithms. Furthermore known marker genes associated with each cell type were assigned to the correct cell type more frequently for the guided versions. We conclude that the use of marker genes improves the accuracy of gene expression deconvolution using NMF and suggest modifications to how the marker gene information is used that may lead to further improvements.},

Several in silico methods for deconvoluting a gene expression profile into cell-type-specific subprofiles have been published but not widely used. Here, we consider recent methods and the experimental validations available for them. Shen-Orr et al. recently developed an approach called cell-type-specific significance analysis of microarray for deconvoluting gene expression. This method requires the measurement of the proportion of each cell type in each sample and the expression profiles of the heterogeneous samples. It determines how gene expression varies among pre-defined phenotypes for each cell type. Gene expression can vary substantially among cell types and sample heterogeneity can mask the identification of biologically important phenotypic correlations. Consequently, the deconvolution approach can be useful in the analysis of mixtures of cell populations in clinical samples.},

  abstract = {Cells grow in dynamically evolving populations, yet this aspect of experiments often goes unmeasured. A method is proposed for measuring the population dynamics of cells on the basis of their mRNA expression patterns. The population's expression pattern is modeled as the linear combination of mRNA expression from pure samples of cells, allowing reconstruction of the relative proportions of pure cell types in the population. Application of the method, termed expression deconvolution, to yeast grown under varying conditions reveals the population dynamics of the cells during the cell cycle, during the arrest of cells induced by DNA damage and the release of arrest in a cell cycle checkpoint mutant, during sporulation, and following environmental stress. Using expression deconvolution, cell cycle defects are detected and temporally ordered in 146 yeast deletion mutants; six of these defects are independently experimentally validated. Expression deconvolution allows a reinterpretation of the cell cycle dynamics underlying all previous microarray experiments and can be more generally applied to study most forms of cell population dynamics.},

@Article{Wang2006a,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarray expression profiling has been widely used to identify differentially expressed genes in complex cellular systems. However, while such methods can be used to directly infer intracellular regulation within homogeneous cell populations, interpretation of in vivo gene expression data derived from complex organs composed of multiple cell types is more problematic. Specifically, observed changes in gene expression may be due either to changes in gene regulation within a given cell type or to changes in the relative abundance of expressing cell types. Consequently, bona fide changes in intrinsic gene regulation may be either mimicked or masked by changes in the relative proportion of different cell types. To date, few analytical approaches have addressed this problem. RESULTS: We have chosen to apply a computational method for deconvoluting gene expression profiles derived from intact tissues by using reference expression data for purified populations of the constituent cell types of the mammary gland. These data were used to estimate changes in the relative proportions of different cell types during murine mammary gland development and Ras-induced mammary tumorigenesis. These computational estimates of changing compartment sizes were then used to enrich lists of differentially expressed genes for transcripts that change as a function of intrinsic intracellular regulation rather than shifts in the relative abundance of expressing cell types. Using this approach, we have demonstrated that adjusting mammary gene expression profiles for changes in three principal compartments--epithelium, white adipose tissue, and brown adipose tissue--is sufficient both to reduce false-positive changes in gene expression due solely to changes in compartment sizes and to reduce false-negative changes by unmasking genuine alterations in gene expression that were otherwise obscured by changes in compartment sizes. CONCLUSION: By adjusting gene expression values for changes in the sizes of cell type-specific compartments, this computational deconvolution method has the potential to increase both the sensitivity and specificity of differential gene expression experiments performed on complex tissues. Given the necessity for understanding complex biological processes such as development and carcinogenesis within the context of intact tissues, this approach offers substantial utility and should be broadly applicable to identifying gene expression changes in tissues composed of multiple cell types.},

Unfortunately, tissue samples used in cancer studies are usually composed of multiple cell types and the non-cancerous portions can significantly affect expression profiles. This severely limits the conclusions that can be made about the specificity of gene expression in the cell-type of interest. However, statistical analysis can be used to identify differentially expressed genes that are related to the biological question being studied. RESULTS: We propose a statistical approach to expression deconvolution from mixed tissue samples in which the proportion of each component cell type is unknown. Our method estimates the proportion of each component in a mixed tissue sample; this estimate can be used to provide estimates of gene expression from each component. We demonstrate our technique on xenograft samples from breast cancer research and publicly available experimental datasets found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus repository.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For heterogeneous tissues, such as blood, measurements of gene expression are confounded by relative proportions of cell types involved. Conclusions have to rely on estimation of gene expression signals for homogeneous cell populations, e.g. by applying micro-dissection, fluorescence activated cell sorting, or in-silico deconfounding. We studied feasibility and validity of a non-negative matrix decomposition algorithm using experimental gene expression data for blood and sorted cells from the same donor samples. Our objective was to optimize the algorithm regarding detection of differentially expressed genes and to enable its use for classification in the difficult scenario of reversely regulated genes. This would be of importance for the identification of candidate biomarkers in heterogeneous tissues. RESULTS: Experimental data and simulation studies involving noise parameters estimated from these data revealed that for valid detection of differential gene expression, quantile normalization and use of non-log data are optimal. We demonstrate the feasibility of predicting proportions of constituting cell types from gene expression data of single samples, as a prerequisite for a deconfounding-based classification approach.Classification cross-validation errors with and without using deconfounding results are reported as well as sample-size dependencies. Implementation of the algorithm, simulation and analysis scripts are available. CONCLUSIONS: The deconfounding algorithm without decorrelation using quantile normalization on non-log data is proposed for biomarkers that are difficult to detect, and for cases where confounding by varying proportions of cell types is the suspected reason. In this case, a deconfounding ranking approach can be used as a powerful alternative to, or complement of, other statistical learning approaches to define candidate biomarkers for molecular diagnosis and prediction in biomedicine, in realistically noisy conditions and with moderate sample sizes.},

  abstract = {A decade ago, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database was established at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The original objective of GEO was to serve as a public repository for high-throughput gene expression data generated mostly by microarray technology. However, the research community quickly applied microarrays to non-gene-expression studies, including examination of genome copy number variation and genome-wide profiling of DNA-binding proteins. Because the GEO database was designed with a flexible structure, it was possible to quickly adapt the repository to store these data types. More recently, as the microarray community switches to next-generation sequencing technologies, GEO has again adapted to host these data sets. Today, GEO stores over 20 000 microarray- and sequence-based functional genomics studies, and continues to handle the majority of direct high-throughput data submissions from the research community. Multiple mechanisms are provided to help users effectively search, browse, download and visualize the data at the level of individual genes or entire studies.

Before the clustering analysis, we apply NMF and PCA for reduction in visualization. The results on one leukemia dataset show that NMF can discover natural clusters and clearly detect one mislabeled sample while PCA cannot. For clustering analysis via k-means, NMF most typically outperforms PCA. Our results demonstrate the superiority of NMF over PCA in reducing microarray data.},

Identification of these genes helps better understanding of tissue-gene relationship, etiology and discovery of novel tissue-specific drug targets. In this study, a statistical method is introduced to detect tissue-specific genes from more than 123 125 gene expression profiles over 107 human tissues, 67 mouse tissues and 30 rat tissues. As a result, a novel subject-specialized repository, namely the tissue-specific genes database (TiSGeD), is developed to represent the analyzed results. Auxiliary information of tissue-specific genes was also collected from biomedical literatures. AVAILABILITY: http://bioinf.xmu.edu.cn/databases/TiSGeD/index.html.},

High-density oligonucleotide arrays offer the opportunity to examine patterns of gene expression on a genome scale. Toward this end, we have designed custom arrays that interrogate the expression of the vast majority of protein-encoding human and mouse genes and have used them to profile a panel of 79 human and 61 mouse tissues. The resulting data set provides the expression patterns for thousands of predicted genes, as well as known and poorly characterized genes, from mice and humans. We have explored this data set for global trends in gene expression, evaluated commonly used lines of evidence in gene prediction methodologies, and investigated patterns indicative of chromosomal organization of transcription. We describe hundreds of regions of correlated transcription and show that some are subject to both tissue and parental allele-specific expression, suggesting a link between spatial expression and imprinting.},

These data set the stage to answer the question of tissue specificity of human transcriptome in a comprehensive manner. Our focus is to uncover the tissue-gene relationship by identifying genes that are preferentially expressed in a small number of tissue types. The tissue selectivity would shed light on the potential physiological functions of these genes and provides an indispensable reference to compare against disease pathophysiology and to identify or validate tissue-specific drug targets. Here we describe a systematic computational and statistical approach to profile gene expression data to identify tissue-selective genes with the use of a more extensive data set and a well-established multiple-comparison procedure with error rate control. Expression data of 35,152 probe sets in 97 normal human tissue types were analyzed, and 3,919 genes were identified to be selective to one or a few tissue types. We presented results of these tissue-selective genes and compared them to those identified by other studies.},

However, accurate measurements of absolute expression levels and the reliable detection of low abundance genes are difficult to achieve.

  abstract = {Cancer derived microarray data sets are routinely produced by various platforms that are either commercially available or manufactured by academic groups. The fundamental difference in their probe selection strategies holds the promise that identical observations produced by more than one platform prove to be more robust when validated by biology. However, cross-platform comparison requires matching corresponding probe sets. We are introducing here sequence-based matching of probes instead of gene identifier-based matching. We analyzed breast cancer cell line derived RNA aliquots using Agilent cDNA and Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarray platforms to assess the advantage of this method. We show, that at different levels of the analysis, including gene expression ratios and difference calls, cross-platform consistency is significantly improved by sequence- based matching. We also present evidence that sequence-based probe matching produces more consistent results when comparing similar biological data sets obtained by different microarray platforms. This strategy allowed a more efficient transfer of classification of breast cancer samples between data sets produced by cDNA microarray and Affymetrix gene-chip platforms.},

@Article{Allen2011,
  abstract = {Access to gene expression data has become increasingly common in recent years; however, analysis has become more difficult as it is often desirable to integrate data from different platforms. Probe mapping across microarray platforms is the first and most crucial step for data integration. In this article, we systematically review and compare different approaches to map probes across seven platforms from different vendors: U95A, U133A and U133 Plus 2.0 from Affymetrix, Inc.; HT-12 v1, HT-12v2 and HT-12v3 from Illumina, Inc.; and 4112A from Agilent, Inc. We use a unique data set, which contains 56 lung cancer cell line samples-each of which has been measured by two different microarray platforms-to evaluate the consistency of expression measurement across platforms using different approaches. Based on the evaluation from the empirical data set, the BLAST alignment of the probe sequences to a recent revision of the Transcriptome generated better results than using annotations provided by Vendors or from Bioconductor's Annotate package. However, a combination of all three methods (deemed the 'Consensus Annotation') yielded the most consistent expression measurement across platforms. To facilitate data integration across microarray platforms for the research community, we develop a user-friendly web-based tool, an API and an R package to map data across different microarray platforms from Affymetrix, Illumina and Agilent.

The cells did not possess Epstein-Barr virus-associated nuclear antigen. These results indicate that THP-1 is a leukemia cell line with distinct monocytic markers.

Five of these were EBNA (Epstein-Barr virus-specific nuclear antigen)-positive. Three, however, were ENBA-negative and lacked Epstein-Barr virus genomes. Two cell lines (KM-3 and SH-2) expressed neither B nor T cell characteristics. One line (JM) expressed T cell characteristics and complement receptors. The growing lymphatic cells represented leukemic cells, since the pattern of cytochemical staining and that of membrane receptors of lymphoblasts from the same donor prior to cultivation were identical. All leukemic cell lines were derived from patients in relapse. In contrast, no proliferation of leukemic cells occurred in explains from patients revealing the first manifestation of the disease. These results suggest enhanced growth potential of lymphoblasts resisting antileukemic therapy.},

Similarities of Ordered Gene Lists (SOGL) is a recently proposed approach to meta-analysis suitable for identifying features shared by two data sets. Here we extend the idea of SOGL to the detection of significant prognostic marker genes from microarrays of multiple data sets. Three data sets for leukemia and the other six for different solid tumors are used to demonstrate our method, using established statistical techniques.},

  abstract = {The application of genome-wide expression analysis to a large-scale, multicentered program in critically ill patients poses a number of theoretical and technical challenges. We describe here an analytical and organizational approach to a systematic evaluation of the variance associated with genome-wide expression analysis specifically tailored to study human disease. We analyzed sources of variance in genome-wide expression analyses performed with commercial oligonucleotide arrays. In addition, variance in gene expression in human blood leukocytes caused by repeated sampling in the same subject, among different healthy subjects, among different leukocyte subpopulations, and the effect of traumatic injury, were also explored. We report that analytical variance caused by sample processing was acceptably small. Blood leukocyte gene expression in the same individual over a 24-h period was remarkably constant. In contrast, genome-wide expression varied significantly among different subjects and leukocyte subpopulations. Expectedly, traumatic injury induced dramatic changes in apparent gene expression that were greater in magnitude than the analytical noise and interindividual variance. We demonstrate that the development of a nation-wide program for gene expression analysis with careful attention to analytical details can reduce the variance in the clinical setting to a level where patterns of gene expression are informative among different healthy human subjects, and can be studied with confidence in human disease.},

  abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

@Article{Lahdesmaki2005,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Very few analytical approaches have been reported to resolve the variability in microarray measurements stemming from sample heterogeneity. For example, tissue samples used in cancer studies are usually contaminated with the surrounding or infiltrating cell types. This heterogeneity in the sample preparation hinders further statistical analysis, significantly so if different samples contain different proportions of these cell types. Thus, sample heterogeneity can result in the identification of differentially expressed genes that may be unrelated to the biological question being studied. Similarly, irrelevant gene combinations can be discovered in the case of gene expression based classification. RESULTS: We propose a computational framework for removing the effects of sample heterogeneity by {"}microdissecting{"} microarray data in silico. The computational method provides estimates of the expression values of the pure (non-heterogeneous) cell samples. The inversion of the sample heterogeneity can be facilitated by providing accurate estimates of the mixing percentages of different cell types in each measurement. For those cases where no such information is available, we develop an optimization-based method for joint estimation of the mixing percentages and the expression values of the pure cell samples. We also consider the problem of selecting the correct number of cell types. CONCLUSION: The efficiency of the proposed methods is illustrated by applying them to a carefully controlled cDNA microarray data obtained from heterogeneous samples. The results demonstrate that the methods are capable of reconstructing both the sample and cell type specific expression values from heterogeneous mixtures and that the mixing percentages of different cell types can also be estimated. Furthermore, a general purpose model selection method can be used to select the correct number of cell types.},

However, molecular analyses by standard gene expression profiling are limited because spatial information and nontumor cell types are lost in sample preparation. We scored 88 prostate specimens for relative content of tumor, benign hyperplastic epithelium, stroma, and dilated cystic glands. The proportions of these cell types were then linked in silico to gene expression levels determined by microarray analysis, revealing unique cell-specific profiles. Gene expression differences for malignant and nonmalignant epithelial cells (tumor versus benign hyperplastic epithelium) could be identified without being confounded by contributions from stroma that dominate many samples or sacrificing possible paracrine influences. Cell-specific expression of selected genes was validated by immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. The results provide patterns of gene expression for these three lineages with relevance to pathogenetic, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations.},

  abstract = {Microarrays measure gene expression typically from a mixture of cell populations during different stages of a biological process. However, the specific effects of the distinct or pure populations on measured gene expression are difficult or impossible to determine. The ability to deconvolve measured gene expression into the contributions from pure populations is critical to maximizing the potential of microarray analysis for investigating complex biological processes. In this paper, we describe a novel approach called the multinomial hidden Markov model (MHMM) that produces: (i) a maximum a posteriori estimate of the fraction represented by each pure population and (ii) gene expression values for each pure population. Our method uses an unsupervised, probabilistic approach for handling missing data points and clusters genes based on expression in pure populations. MHMM, used with several yeast datasets, identified statistically significant temporal dynamics. This method, unlike the linear decomposition models used previously for deconvolution, can extract information from different types of data, does not require a priori identification of pure gene expression, exploits the temporal nature of time series data, and is less affected by missing data.},

Here we report the application of a two-way clustering method for analyzing a data set consisting of the expression patterns of different cell types. Gene expression in 40 tumor and 22 normal colon tissue samples was analyzed with an Affymetrix oligonucleotide array complementary to more than 6,500 human genes. An efficient two-way clustering algorithm was applied to both the genes and the tissues, revealing broad coherent patterns that suggest a high degree of organization underlying gene expression in these tissues. Coregulated families of genes clustered together, as demonstrated for the ribosomal proteins. Clustering also separated cancerous from noncancerous tissue and cell lines from in vivo tissues on the basis of subtle distributed patterns of genes even when expression of individual genes varied only slightly between the tissues. Two-way clustering thus may be of use both in classifying genes into functional groups and in classifying tissues based on gene expression.},

We demonstrate the ability of NMF to recover meaningful biological information from cancer-related microarray data. NMF appears to have advantages over other methods such as hierarchical clustering or self-organizing maps. We found it less sensitive to a priori selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or context-dependent patterns of gene expression in complex biological systems. This ability, similar to semantic polysemy in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern discovery.},

For example, the most highly utilized platforms for gene expression microarrays, Affymetrix GeneChip® arrays, have as many as ten or more probe sets for some genes. Occasionally, individual probe sets for the same gene report different trends in expression across experimental conditions, a situation that must be resolved in order to accurately interpret the data. We developed an algorithm, SCOREM, for determining the level of agreement between such probe sets, utilizing a statistical test of concordance, Kendall's W coefficient of concordance, and a graph-searching algorithm for the identification of concordant probe sets. We also present methods for consolidating concordant groups into a single value for its corresponding gene and for post hoc analysis of discordant groups. By combining statistical consolidation with sequence analysis, SCOREM possesses the unique ability to identify biologically meaningful discordant behaviors, including differing behaviors in alternate RNA isoforms and tissue-specific patterns of expression. When consolidating concordant behaviors, SCOREM outperforms other methods in detecting both differential expression and overrepresented functional categories.},

  abstract = {This book is intended as an introductory text for use in immunology courses for medical students, advanced undergraduate biology students, graduate students, and scientists in other fields who want to know more about the immune system. It attempts to present the field of immunology from a consistent viewpoint, that of the hosts interaction with an environment containing many species of potentially harmful microbes. The justification for this approach is that the absence of one or more components of the immune system is virtually always made clear by an increased susceptibility to one or more specific infections. Thus, first and foremost, the immune system exists to protect the host from infection, and its evolutionary history must have been shaped largely by this challenge. Other aspects of immunology, such as allergy, autoimmunity, graft rejection, and immunity to tumors, are treated as variations on this basic protective function. In these cases the nature of the antigen is the major variable.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many practical pattern recognition problems require non-negativity constraints. For example, pixels in digital images and chemical concentrations in bioinformatics are non-negative. Sparse non-negative matrix factorizations (NMFs) are useful when the degree of sparseness in the non-negative basis matrix or the non-negative coefficient matrix in an NMF needs to be controlled in approximating high-dimensional data in a lower dimensional space. RESULTS: In this article, we introduce a novel formulation of sparse NMF and show how the new formulation leads to a convergent sparse NMF algorithm via alternating non-negativity-constrained least squares. We apply our sparse NMF algorithm to cancer-class discovery and gene expression data analysis and offer biological analysis of the results obtained. Our experimental results illustrate that the proposed sparse NMF algorithm often achieves better clustering performance with shorter computing time compared to other existing NMF algorithms.

  abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

  abstract = {A new variant ?PMF? of factor analysis is described. It is assumed that X is a matrix of observed data and ? is the known matrix of standard deviations of elements of X. Both X and ? are of dimensions n × m. The method solves the bilinear matrix problem X = GF + E where G is the unknown left hand factor matrix (scores) of dimensions n × p, F is the unknown right hand factor matrix (loadings) of dimensions p × m, and E is the matrix of residuals. The problem is solved in the weighted least squares sense: G and F are determined so that the Frobenius norm of E divided (element-by-element) by ? is minimized. Furthermore, the solution is constrained so that all the elements of G and F are required to be non-negative. It is shown that the solutions by PMF are usually different from any solutions produced by the customary factor analysis (FA, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) followed by rotations). Usually PMF produces a better fit to the data than FA. Also, the result of PF is guaranteed to be non-negative, while the result of FA often cannot be rotated so that all negative entries would be eliminated. Different possible application areas of the new method are briefly discussed. In environmental data, the error estimates of data can be widely varying and non-negativity is often an essential feature of the underlying models. Thus it is concluded that PMF is better suited than FA or PCA in many environmental applications. Examples of successful applications of PMF are shown in companion papers.},

  abstract = {Microarrays can measure the expression of thousands of genes to identify changes in expression between different biological states. Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12\%, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84\% by using conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.},

Cell type transcriptomes carried enough information to categorize cells into morphological classes and types. Several genes that were specifically expressed in particular retinal circuit elements, such as inhibitory neuron types, are associated with eye diseases. The resource described here allows gene expression to be compared across adult retinal cell types, experimenting with specific transcription factors to differentiate stem or somatic cells to retinal cell types, and predicting cellular targets of newly discovered disease-associated genes.},

In silico dissection of mixed cell samples is essential for analyzing expression data generated in cancer studies. Currently, a systematic approach is lacking to address three challenges in computational deconvolution: 1) violation of linear addition of expression levels from multiple tissues when log-transformed microarray data are used; 2) estimation of both tumor proportion and tumor-specific expression, when neither is known a priori; and 3) estimation of expression profiles for individual patients.

We demonstrate the performance of our model in synthetic and real, publicly available, datasets. DeMix can be applied to ongoing biomarker-based clinical studies and to the vast expression datasets previously generated from mixed tumor and stromal cell samples.
