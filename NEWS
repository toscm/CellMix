CHANGES
    o RcppOctave moves from Suggests to Enhances
    to enable Bioconductor check.

BUG FIXES
    o Fixes a bug due to S4 method dispatch on 
    union classes. Now ged works on objects that 
    inherit from ExpressionSet, e.g. LumiBatch 
    objects.
    See the following R-devel thread for more detail on the issue: 
    https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2013-May/066609.html

NEW FEATURES
    o the functions based on applyBy now accept ExpressionSet objects
    and conserve/collapse feature and samples annotations if present.

CHANGES
    o GEOquery changed from Depends to Suggests, so that it needs to be 
    installed if one wants to download dataset from GEO.
    In interactive session, it installation is proposed.
    This is to limit dependencies and initial download (for some reason 
    GEOquery's source package is big).   
    o A project has been created on Bitbucket with a 
    public issue tracker url referenced in the DESCRIPTION file.
    Note: this repo might eventually migrate to Github.
    o An R-forge project has been created that host both CellMix and csSAM.
    Note: all myCRAN stuff should migrate there, once R-forge building system is
    fixed.
    o Removed GEOquery hooks, which where fixing bugs in 
    the GEOquery package that have been fixed in Bioc 2.12 (issue #3)
    o applyBy is now an S3 method, with methods for matrix and ExpressionSet
    objects.

BUG FIXES
    o Annotation packages are not required any more to load 
    marker lists (issue #7).
    o Installation of optional Annotation/Bioconductor packages 
    now use biocLite to ensure relevant repositories are found (issue #5)
    o Registry datasets could not be reloaded from the "raw" files 
    as downloaded from data repositories (issue #6)
    o A couple of minor changes have been made to ensure full compatibility
    with R-3.0
